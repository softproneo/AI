<h2>Tetris with Aritificail Inteligence</h2>
<h1>Made by SoftProNeo & Pavel Pavlov</h1>
<p>This is the classic tetris game but inside in core has the second option.</p>
<p>This second option is artificial intelligence who work very fast and foresees each next step in the game.</p>
<p>Each new step of artificial intelligence in the game allows it to become better and self-educate.</p>
<p>This game was created entirely by the creator of SoftProNeo</p>
